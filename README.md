# Maze-Solving--Multiple-bots-Multiple-Destination(Swarm Tech)

This project involves applying a unique algorithm to sove the problem of multiple bots, Multiple destinations in optimal distance and time
• Implemented A-Star algorithm to drive the bots from start to destination, using multiple Heuristic functions
• Formulated a new algorithm simulating a real-world system using intermediate checkpoint method and increased time efficiency
