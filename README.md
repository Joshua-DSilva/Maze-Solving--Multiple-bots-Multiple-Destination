# Maze-Solving--Multiple-bots-Multiple-Destination(Swarm Tech)

The problem statement given is ( in brief ):
		There are 6 levels that are needed to be solved. The backdrop is a 200*200 image
		consisting of blue bots, and green nodes. An efficient code is required to move 
		the bot to all the nodes in an effective way.
		Level 1 : 1 bot 1 node
		Level 2 : 1 bot multiple nodes
		Level 3 : 2 bots multiple nodes
		Level 4 : multiple bots multiple nodes
		Level 5 : 2 bots with multiple nodes and red obstacles
		Level 6 : multiple bots with multiple nodes and red obstacles

Approach -
• Cleared all 6 Levels
• Implemented A-Star algorithm to drive the bots from start to destination, using multiple Heuristic functions
• Formulated a new algorithm simulating a real-world system using intermediate checkpoint method and increased time efficiency
